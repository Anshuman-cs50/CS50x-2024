Answer 1:
    Based on the top 100 songs of the listener, his audio aura can ba characterised as follows:

        1. Energy: The average energy of the top 100 songs is 0.65906. Which is greater than 0.25 and less than 0.75. This means that the listenter's songs are moderately energetic.

        2. Valence: The average valence of the top 100 songs is 0.484443. Which is greater than 0.25 and less than 0.75. This means that the listener's songs are neutral: neither particularly happy or sad.

        3. Danceability: The average danceability of the top 100 songs is 0.71646. Which is nearly 0.75 but lesser. This means that the listener likes to listen songs which are quite danceable.

    Based on the average values, we can conclude that the user's two prominent moods are: Danceable and Energetic.

Answer 2:
    Why this method might not be very representative:
        1. Temporary variations: Due to some real life events, the taste in music of a person varies. These variations during a perod of time cannot be correctly measured by this method.

        2. Diversity is music: The listener might have a variety of taste in music which cannot be well represented by these averages.

    Better ways of calculating the audio aura which I propose:
        1. Weighted averages: Instead of using just the averages, we can use weighted averages by taking the number of times the songs have been played. This might give us a different result.

        2. Periodic analysis: We can use periodic analysis of the listener's music taste to analyse the variations of taste by changing months and seasons.
